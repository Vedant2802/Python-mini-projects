# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python mini projects, code snippets, and learning resources. The codebase is organized for easy navigation and learning.

## Folder Structure

- `python_basics/` — Fundamental Python concepts and basic examples (loops, conditionals, functions, data types, etc.)
- `projects/` — Complete or larger Python projects and OOP examples (e.g., car, compound interest calculator)
- `snippets/` — Small, focused code snippets and utilities for quick reference (e.g., string operations, math, user input, list/dictionary/set/tuple operations)
- `javascript/` — JavaScript code snippets
- `docs/` — Documentation and cheat sheets (e.g., Python OOP cheat sheet)

## Getting Started

Browse the folders to find code examples and mini projects. Each file is self-contained and can be run independently.

## Example Projects

- **car.py**: Demonstrates OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes.
- **CompoundInterest.py**: Calculates compound interest using user input.

## Learning Resources

- **python_basics/**: Start here if you're new to Python or want to review core concepts.
- **docs/python_oop_cheat_sheet.md**: Quick reference for Python OOP.
